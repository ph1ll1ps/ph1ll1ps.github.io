title: "Researchers build nanoscale distributed DNA computing systems from artificial protocells"
subtitle: "For DNA devices to work, they have to stay intact. Researchers have devised a method to encapsulate the molecules inside protocells, not only protecting them from enzyme degradation but also improving their processing speed and functionality. - <a href = https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/researchers-build-nanoscale-distributed-dna-computing-systems-from-artificial-protocells/>Microsoft Research Blog</a>"
