My role as Director of Bioinformatics in Biologics Engineering at AstraZeneca is to lead the development of an end-to-end data management and analysis strategy and capabilities that will significantly impact the delivery of the novel biologics drugs of the future. Open positions for my team are listed below and are available immediately. 

Biologics Engineering is responsible for the discovery and optimisation of next generation biological drug candidates for all key therapy areas across AstraZeneca, including oncology, respiratory and inflammation, cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases. We are constantly pushing the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines to patients, with a passion for developing in-house biologics discovery platforms and novel drug modalities to address unmet medical needs.

Central to this effort is the development of end-to-end data management and analysis capabilities to deliver novel biologics drugs. You will be part of an interdisciplinary Bioinformatics team, working at the cutting edge of research and development to create an <i>active learning system for biologics engineering</i>, in which model predictions guide lab experiments, lab automation generates high-throughput data for model training, and predictive models are updated as new data are generated. As part of this effort, you will collaborate closely with experts in data management, software engineering, lab automation, computational modelling and machine learning, with access to biologics R&D data across AstraZeneca and the potential to generate new data to inform predictive models.
