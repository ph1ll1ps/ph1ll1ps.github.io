  description = "Supervised by Luca Cardelli and Stephen Emmott. Created the Stochastic Pi Machine (SPiM) programming language for computational modelling of biological systems. The language is based on a formal model of concurrency known as the pi-calculus, and the simulation algorithm is based on stochastic kinetics of physical chemistry. <br><br>Developed a formal specification of the language syntax and semantics (CMSB 2007), together with a corresponding graphical formalism for representing computational models (TCSB 2006b) and their execution traces (ENTCS 2008). Used the language for compositional modelling of synthetic gene circuits (TCSB 2006)."
