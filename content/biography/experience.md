  description = "Created the Stochastic Pi Machine (SPiM) programming language for computational modelling of biological systems. The language is based on a formal model of concurrency known as the pi-calculus, and the simulation algorithm is based on stochastic theory of chemical kinetics. <br><br>Developed a formal specification of the language syntax, semantics and implementation (<a href = \"http://localhost:1313/publication/phillips2007/\">CMSB 2007</a>). Developed a graphical formalism for representing computational models (<a href = \"http://localhost:1313/publication/phillips2006/\">TCSB 2006</a>) and their execution traces (<a href = \"http://localhost:1313/publication/borgstrom2008/\">ENTCS 2008</a>). Used the language for compositional modelling of synthetic gene circuits (<a href = \"http://localhost:1313/publication/blossey2006/\">TCSB 2006</a>). Supervised by Luca Cardelli and Stephen Emmott."
