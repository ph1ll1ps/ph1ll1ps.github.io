description = "Led research in Biological Computation at Microsoft, developing methods for understanding and programming information processing in biological systems:<br><br><ul> <li>Jointly led scientific research with Dave Zhang on predicting DNA interactions from sequence (Nature Communications 2021, Nature Chemistry 2018).</li><li>Jointly led scientific research with Paul Grant on programming cell populations (Nature Communications 2020). Main experiments performed at Microsoft in the Station B wet lab. </li> <li>Led the development of the <a href = /project/visualdsd/>Visual DSD</a> programming language for designing molecular circuits. Developed new computational methods and incorporated them into the language. Used this language with collaborators to make scientific advances (Nature Nanotechnology 2013, 2017, 2019).</li> <li>Led the development of the <a href = /project/visualgec/>Visual GEC</a> programming language for designing genetic circuits, which underpinned the computational modelling of experiments performed in the Station B wet lab. Developed new computational methods and incorporated them into the language. Used the methods with collaborators to make scientific advances (Molecular Systems Biology 2016, Nature Communications 2018, 2020).</li> </ul>Led the creation of academic and industrial partnerships:<br><br> <ul><li>Led a team to create a research partnership between Station B and the Novartis Cell & Gene Therapy division (Microsoft News 2019, <a href = /post/financialtimes2019/>Financial Times 2019</a>). </li> <li> Led a team to develop the Station B platform (<a href = /post/naturebiotechnology2019/>Nature Biotechnology 2019</a>) and to create research partnerships with Princeton University and Oxford Biomedica (Wall Street Journal 2019, Bloomberg 2019).</li> <li> Led the creation and launch of the Station B initiative, with the aim of developing a platform for programming biological systems (Microsoft Research 2019). Secured Microsoft funding to grow Station B to a 10-person team.</li> <li>Led a team to create the first molecular biology laboratory at Microsoft (<a href = /post/fastcompany2016/>Fast Company 2016</a>). </li> <li>Proposed the concept for a Microsoft Office Envisioning video on a future version of Office for biotechnology. 2M views (<a href = /post/office2015/>Office Envisioning 2015</a>).</li> </ul> Led strategy and communication with senior leadership:<br><br> <ul><li>Strategic presentations to Microsoft senior leadership to obtain buy-in and financial support for Synthetic Biology research over a 10-year period. Includes presentations to Microsoft's CEO, President, Senior Leadership Team and Board of Directors.</li><li>Worked extensively with Business Development and Corporate Strategy to create a strategic vision for Synthetic Biology at Microsoft, which enabled sustained investment and growth in Synthetic Biology research.</li></ul>"

  description = "Created the Stochastic Pi Machine (SPiM) programming language for computational modelling of biological systems. The language is based on a formal model of concurrency known as the pi-calculus, and the simulation algorithm is based on stochastic theory of chemical kinetics. <br><br>Developed a formal specification of the language syntax and semantics (<a href = \"/publication/phillips2007/\">CMSB 2007</a>). Developed a graphical formalism for models in the language (<a href = \"/publication/phillips2006/\">TCSB 2006</a>) and their execution traces (<a href = \"/publication/borgstrom2008/\">ENTCS 2008</a>). Used the language for compositional modelling of synthetic gene circuits (<a href = \"/publication/blossey2006/\">TCSB 2006</a>). <br><br>Contributing author and co-editor of the 2020 Science Report, highlighted in (<a href = /post/nature2006/>Nature 2006</a>). Supervised by Luca Cardelli and Stephen Emmott."
