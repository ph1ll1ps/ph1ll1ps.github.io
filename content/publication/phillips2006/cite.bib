abstract = {This paper presents a graphical representation for the stochastic $\pi$-calculus, which is formalised by defining a corresponding graphical calculus. The graphical calculus is shown to be reduction equivalent to stochastic $\pi$, ensuring that the two calculi have the same expressive power. The graphical representation is used to model a couple of example biological systems, namely a bistable gene network and a mapk signalling cascade. One of the benefits of the representation is its ability to highlight the existence of cycles, which are a key feature of biological systems. Another benefit is its ability to animate interactions between system components, in order to visualise system dynamics. The graphical representation can also be used as a front end to a simulator for the stochastic $\pi$-calculus, to help make modelling and simulation of biological systems more accessible to non computer scientists.},
