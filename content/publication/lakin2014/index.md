abstract: "Sequence-specific DNA interactions are a powerful means of programming nanoscale locomotion. These systems typically use a DNA track that is tethered to a surface, and molecular interactions enable a signal or cargo to traverse this track. Such low copy number systems are highly amenable to mechanized analyses such as probabilistic model checking, which requires a formal encoding. In this paper we present the first general encoding of tethered DNA species into a formal language, which allows the interactions between tethered species to be derived automatically using standard reaction rules. We apply this encoding to a previously published tethered DNA circuit architecture based on hairpin assembly reactions. This work enables automated analysis of large-scale tethered DNA circuits and, potentially, synthesis of optimized track layouts to implement specific logic functions."
